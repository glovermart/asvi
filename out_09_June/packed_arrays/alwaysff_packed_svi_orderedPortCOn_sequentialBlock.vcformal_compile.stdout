Error-[ICPD_INIT] Illegal combination of drivers
testcases/alwaysff_packed_svi_orderedPortCOn_sequentialBlock.sv, 14
  Illegal combination of procedural drivers
  Variable "i" is driven by an invalid combination of procedural drivers. 
  Variables written on left-hand of "always_ff" cannot be written to by any 
  other processes, including other "always_ff" processes.
  This variable is declared at 
  "testcases/alwaysff_packed_svi_orderedPortCOn_sequentialBlock.sv", 14: int 
  i;
  The first driver is at 
  "testcases/alwaysff_packed_svi_orderedPortCOn_sequentialBlock.sv", 16: 
  always_ff @(posedge i_clk) begin
  x[i] <= i_a;
   ...
  The second driver is at 
  "testcases/alwaysff_packed_svi_orderedPortCOn_sequentialBlock.sv", 14: i = 
  0;
  Use '-ignore initializer_driver_checks' to suppress this error
