  > Reset violations (grouped by reset expressions)

      Reset of these flip-flop groups are not always inactive during formal:

      [   0]    u_M3.p.z_OP0
                u_M3.p.y_OP0
                u_M3.p.x_OP0

  > Clock violations (grouped by clock expressions)

      Clock inputs of these flip-flop groups switch on input changes:
