2023-02-16
----------
- DDF meeting
- Started work on first 15 initial testcases
  - Made 2 simple test cases using always_ff in the files
    `alwaysff_port.sv` & `alwaysff_svi.sv`.
  - Made 2 simple test cases using always_latch in the files
    `alwayslatch_inst.sv` & `alwayslatch_svi.sv`.
  - Did a quick check of testcases in Vivado;
    - Only 2x test cases with *_port.sv from 8/15 test cases are elaborated
      (Including `test1.sv`).
    - All other test cases are not elaborated.
    - Only `test1.sv` is synthesizable.
    - All other test cases are not synthesizable.
- To Do
  - Investigate cause of no elaboration in some test cases.
  - Investigate cause of no synthesis in testcases other than `test1.sv`.
  - Complete the remaining 7/ 15 test cases.
- Clues as to why some testcases are not able to be elaborated or synthesized:
  - Improper connections/ Instationtion? Some top level ports not connected?
  - Compare other testcases with `test1.sv`.
  - Signals from interface after instantion in top module are not used?
  - Signals not having direction?
  - Module top and/ or interface having no output?

2023-02-21
----------
- Completed the 15 initial testcases.
- Used `force` procedural-continuous assignment with always_comb instead of
  initial begin end statements.
- Check if this is allowed since examples seen use this in initial blocks.
- `alwayslatch_port` and `assign_port` elaborated in Vivado 2020.1.
- `force` not supported in Vivado 2020.1.
- Other testcases failed to elaborate in Vivado.
- To Do
  - Start tutorials/ work on Makefiles.
