Error-[SV-UAAC] Unpacked Array Assigned by MultiConcat
testcases/assign_unpacked_svi_noLiteral.sv, 9
I, "{8 {i_a}}"
  Unpacked array of type 'logic$[7:0]' can't be assigned by multiple 
  concatenation operator {8 {i_a}}
  However, repeat assignment pattern can be assigned to unpacked arrays. Add a
  ' before the multiple concatenation operator to convert it to a valid 
  assignment pattern.
