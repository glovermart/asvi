Error-[ICPD_INIT] Illegal combination of drivers
testcases/alwaysff_packed_modport.sv, 23
  Illegal combination of procedural drivers
  Variable "i" is driven by an invalid combination of procedural drivers. 
  Variables written on left-hand of "always_ff" cannot be written to by any 
  other processes, including other "always_ff" processes.
  This variable is declared at "testcases/alwaysff_packed_modport.sv", 23: int
  i;
  The first driver is at "testcases/alwaysff_packed_modport.sv", 28: always_ff
  @(posedge i_clk) i <= (i + 'b1);
  The second driver is at "testcases/alwaysff_packed_modport.sv", 23: i = 0;
  Use '-ignore initializer_driver_checks' to suppress this error
