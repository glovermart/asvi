Error-[IAPC] Illegal array port connection
testcases/assign_arrayofSVI_port.sv, 42
  Width or dimension mismatch in array instance port connection:
  The packed connection expression width doesn't match the port width of the 
  array instance (1 bit).
  Port: inout 'p' of module 'M'
  Expression: u_I
  Source info: M u_M( .p (u_I),  .i_a (i_a));
  A packed array instance port connection must either match the instance port 
  by width directly, or its width must be the port width times the number of 
  instances in the array instance.
