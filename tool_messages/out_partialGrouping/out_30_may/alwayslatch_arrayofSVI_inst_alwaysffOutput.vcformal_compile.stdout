Error-[ICPD_INIT] Illegal combination of drivers
testcases/alwayslatch_arrayofSVI_inst_alwaysffOutput.sv, 38
  Illegal combination of procedural drivers
  Variable "i_i" is driven by an invalid combination of procedural drivers. 
  Variables written on left-hand of "always_ff" cannot be written to by any 
  other processes, including other "always_ff" processes.
  This variable is declared at 
  "testcases/alwayslatch_arrayofSVI_inst_alwaysffOutput.sv", 38: int i_i;
  The first driver is at 
  "testcases/alwayslatch_arrayofSVI_inst_alwaysffOutput.sv", 39: always_ff 
  @(posedge i_clk) begin
  if (i_i >= $unit::SIZE) begin
   ...
  The second driver is at 
  "testcases/alwayslatch_arrayofSVI_inst_alwaysffOutput.sv", 38: i_i = 0;
  Use '-ignore initializer_driver_checks' to suppress this error
